# Horiseon - Challenge-1

## Description

The purpose of my project was to reformat the site from non-semantic to semantic. I did this so the code would have easier readability. I learned how to consolidate CSS code so that it does not repeat the same information. I also learned how to structure the code from non-semantic to semantic. 

## Installation

Initially, I ran into trouble downloading my code from GitHub and had to reach out to AskBCS for direction. From here, I was able to create a repository and save my First Commit, which was the original code. I learned that to commit to Github, you must follow these steps: 
1. git add -A
2. git commit -m "content description here"
3. git push origin main
I followed these steps each time I made a significant change to the code. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
