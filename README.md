# Horiseon - Challenge-1

## Description

The purpose of my project was to reformat the site from non-semantic to semantic. I did this so the code would have easier readability. I learned how to consolidate CSS code so that it does not repeat the same information. I also learned how to structure the code from non-semantic to semantic. 

## Installation

Initially, I ran into trouble downloading my code from GitHub and had to reach out to AskBCS for direction. From here, I was able to create a repository and save my First Commit, which was the original code. I learned that to commit to Github, you must follow these steps: 
1. git add -A
2. git commit -m "content description here"
3. git push origin main

I followed these steps each time I made a significant change to the code. 

## Usage

Clone the repository from GitHub to your desktop. You can do this by selecting the green code button and then copy the HTTPS code. Next, you need to open GitBash and enter the folder you would like the repo saved to. Type "git clone" and paste the HTTPS code after. Press enter. You have now saved the repository for GitHub. Type "code ." to open the repository in Visual Studios.

At this point, you may select to view the HTML code by selecting the index.html file, or you can view the CSS code by entering the assets folder, then the css folder, and then select style.css.
